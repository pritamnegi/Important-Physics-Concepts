# Important Definitions

Unit is the quantity of a constant magnitude which is used to measure the magnitudes of other quantities of the same nature.

# Fundamental Quantity

Fundamental quantities are the basic or base quantities. These are independent of each other. They consist of the quantities which are essential to form all other physical quantities apart from fundamental quantities.
E.g. Length, Mass, Time

# Derived Quantity

The quantities that are derived using the fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. The units that are used to measure these derived quantities are called derived units. 
Examples: Force, Velocity, Density, Heat, Power, Energy, Momentum, Acceleration.
