# Important Definitions

Unit is the quantity of a constant magnitude which is used to measure the magnitudes of other quantities of the same nature.

# System of Units

1. CGS: Centimetre Gram Second system
2. MKS: Metre Kilogram Second system
3. FPS: Foot Pound Second System
4. SI: System International

# Fundamental Quantity

Fundamental quantities are the basic or base quantities. These are independent of each other. They consist of the quantities which are essential to form all other physical quantities apart from fundamental quantities.\
E.g. Length, Mass, Time

# Derived Quantity

The quantities that are derived using the fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. The units that are used to measure these derived quantities are called derived units.\
E.g. Force, Velocity, Density, Heat, Power, Energy, Momentum, Acceleration.

# Fundamental Units

The units used to measure fundamental quantities are called fundamental units.\
E.g. metre, kilogram etc.

# Derived Units

The units used to measure derived quantities are called derived units\
E.g. Unit of velocity = metre/second (m/s) 

# Supplementary Units

Besides the seven fundamental or basic units, there are two more units called supplementary units. They are as follows:
1. Plane Angle
2. Solid Angle

# Dimensions
The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers to which the concerned fundamental units must be raised in order to obtain the unit of the given physical quantity
