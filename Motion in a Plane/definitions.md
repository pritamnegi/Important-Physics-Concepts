# Rectilinear Motion

It is a linear motion in which the direction of the velocity remains constant and the path is a straight line.

# Displacement

The displacement of the object between $t_1$ and $t_2$ is the difference between the position vectors of the object at the two instances.

# Path Length

This is the actual distance travelled by the object during its motion. It is a scalar quantity and its dimensions are also that of length.
