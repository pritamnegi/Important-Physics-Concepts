# Scalar Quantity

Scalar quantity is defined as the physical quantity with magnitude and no direction.
Scalars can be described just by their numerical value (with their respective units) without directions (they donâ€™t have any direction).
E.g. Length, Mass

# Vector Quantity

A vector quantity is defined as the physical quantity that has both direction as well as magnitude.
E.g. Displacement, Velocity, Time


# Types of Vectors

## 1. Zero Vector

A vector having zero magnitude with a particular direction (arbitrary) is called zero vector.

## 2. Resultant Vector

The resultant of two or more vectors is that single vector, which produces the same effect, as produced by all the vectors together.

## 3. Negative Vector

A negative vector of a given vector is a vector of the same magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the given vector.

## 4. Equal Vectors

Two vectors A and B representing same physical quantity are said to be equal if and only if they have the same magnitude and direction.

## 5. Position Vector

A vector which gives the position of a particle at a point with respect to the origin of a chosen coordinate system is called the position vector of the particle.

## 6. Unit Vector

A vector having unit magnitude in a given direction is called a unit vector in that direction.


# Vector Operations

## 1. Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar

Multiplying a vector by a scalar quantity say s, yields another vector.

## 2. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

The addition or subtraction of two or more vectors of the same type, i.e. describing the same physical quantity, gives rise to a single vector, such that the effect of this single vector is the same as the net effect of the vectors which have been added or subtracted.

## 3. Triangle Law for Vector Addition

If two vectors describing the same physical quantity are represented in magnitude and direction by the two sides of a triangle taken in order, then their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the third side of the triangle drawn in the opposite sense (from the starting point of first vector to the end point of the second vector).

Properties of Vector addition:
1. Vector addition is commutative
2. Vector addition is associative
