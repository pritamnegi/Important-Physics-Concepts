# Scalar Quantity

Scalar quantity is defined as the physical quantity with magnitude and no direction.
Scalars can be described just by their numerical value (with their respective units) without directions (they donâ€™t have any direction).
E.g. Length, Mass

# Vector Quantity

A vector quantity is defined as the physical quantity that has both direction as well as magnitude.
E.g. Displacement, Velocity, Time


# Types of Vectors

## 1. Zero Vector

A vector having zero magnitude with a particular direction (arbitrary) is called zero vector.

## 2. Resultant Vector

The resultant of two or more vectors is that single vector, which produces the same effect, as produced by all the vectors together.

## 3. Negative Vector

A negative vector of a given vector is a vector of the same magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the given vector.

## 4. Equal Vectors

Two vectors A and B representing same physical quantity are said to be equal if and only if they have the same magnitude and direction.
